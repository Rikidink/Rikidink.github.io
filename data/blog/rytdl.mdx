summary: Building a web app and desktop app to download YouTube videos using Vite + React + Express + Electron

# Preface

Firstly, it has been many months since I've done a blog post...oops. But the important thing is that I'm back
right?

Secondly, I've made a new web app! As the title already states, this one is a YouTube video downloader app that
can be run as a traditional web app or **desktop app** via Electron.

What I mean by a desktop app is that there is a zip file that contains the whole app packaged into a `.exe` file which runs
**both** the frontend **AND** backend in an Electron app. The coolest part though is that anyone can download the desktop app
and run it on their system regardless of whether they have NodeJS or any of the dependencies.

This was actually my first time using React and Electron and I'm very much a backend developer so the code is probably not all that good...
but hey! It works right? Which is all that really matters.

Now hold on, what even is Electron? And why is it relevant when making desktop apps? Well, to put it simply:
Electron is basically a framework that allows you to run web-apps in desktop applications/windows. The way this is done is
that Electron renders the app using a Chromium browser and runs the app on a packaged NodeJS environment.

It's typically used to package **only** frontend apps (such as React apps) but as we'll see in this post, I also managed to
make it run the Node/Express REST Api backend too, albeit, in a slightly dodgy manner...

# Backend

Now before diving into making this thing a desktop app, we have to actually make it into an ordinary web app first.

Let's talk about the backend first.

The backend is a classic Node app that uses Express to create a REST Api. There's only 2 endpoints (a GET and POST request) so its pretty straightforward but the technicalities that arise when dealing with
downloading videos and processing them is where it gets complicated so lets delve a bit deeper into that.

The backend utilises 2 main resources to download and process the videos:

1. `ytdl-core` (the DistubeJS fork of it)
2. `ffmpeg`

`ytdl-core` is essentially a YouTube video downloader node module.

Now, you're probably thinking, if this module does all the downloading for you, why would the overall process be complicated? Well, as it turns out, YouTube "videos" are seperated into two parts:

1. The video file
2. And the audio file

These seperate parts will need to be merged **after** downloading for there to be the whole, complete video with audio.

This is where `ffmpeg` comes in. `ffmpeg` is a software package that processes and handles audio and video files/streams. One of its many functionalities is, you guessed it, merging video and audio files.

`ffmpeg` isn't a node module that can just be installed using `npm` though, it's an actual software package that has to be installed and downloaded onto your system as a `.exe` and interfaced using the
`fluent-ffmpeg` node module. Normally, `fluent-ffmpeg` uses the `ffmpeg` installed globally on your system (i.e. the one referenced by the `PATH` variable) but I've chosen for it to use a `ffmpeg` that sits in the
same directory as the backend. The reason for this is if we want this app to be a packaged desktop app that **anyone** can use (with or without NodeJS or other dependencies installed on their system), we can't assume
the user has `ffmpeg` installed already which is why `ffmpeg` will come bundled with the desktop app.

One annoying thing

# Frontend

For the frontend, I chose React, specifically a React app created using Vite.

Now, what is Vite? I'll keep it short since its not super important in the grand scheme of things: Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool for web applications (like React!). With Vite, starting and compiling
the React app takes waaaaay less longer compared to, for example, the standard `create-react-app` command.
