# Hash tables! What are they?

I'm sure we have used them in one way or another; whether as a `dict()` in Python, a `HashMap<>()` in Java, or as a `Map()` in JavaScript (as a side note,
JavaScript objects are also basically hash tables) **insert footnote**. But how do these implementations of hash tables work in these languages under the hood?

# Introduction

First off, for those of you who do not know, a hash table is a data structure that implements the associative array abstract data type **insert footnote**
that stores `(key, value)` pairs where all keys in the hash table are unique and distinct from eachother. Insertion, deletion, and
lookup/search operations on hash tables take as input a key and inserts/deletes based on the input value.

For example, consider the following code snippet of a hash table in Python:

```python
hash_table = dict()

# insert pair (10, "hello") and (20, "world")
hash_table[10] = "hello"
hash_table[20] = "world"
# hash_table is now {10: "hello", 20: "world"}

# delete pair (10, "hello")
del hash_table[10]
# hash_table is now {20: "world"}

# retrieve value at key 20:
value = hash_table[20]
# value is "world"
```

And here's the cool part:

\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline \text{Operation} & \text{Average case} & \text{Worst case} \\
    \hline Insert&Θ(1)&O(n) \\
    \hline Delete&Θ(1)&O(n) \\
    \hline Lookup&Θ(1)&O(n) \\
    \hline
\end{array}
$$

All the operations have constant time average case!

Ok cool so we can get values from a hash table based on a unique key but how does a hash table work behind the scenes?
